Enabling CORS

To enable CORS support, you need to set the option enable_cors = true in the [httpd] section of local.ini, and [cors] section with origins = *. Note that by default, no origins are accepted, you must either use a wildcard or whitelist.

[httpd]
enable_cors = true

[cors]
origins = *

Tightening Access

Restricting by Protocol, Host and optional Port

[cors]
; List of origins, separated by a comma (protocol, host, port)
; refer to http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454 for specification
origins = http://home.muse.net.nz:8000, https://localhost, http://www.number10.gov.uk:80
